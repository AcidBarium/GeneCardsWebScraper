ATAD3B,"NCBI Gene Summary   :   The protein encoded by this gene is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it can bind to a highly-related protein, ATAD3A. ATAD3A appears to interact with matrix nucleoid complexes, and the encoded protein negatively regulates that interaction. This gene is expressed almost exclusively in pluripotent embryonic stem cells and some cancer cells. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Among its related pathways are Innate Immune System and 1p36 copy number variation syndrome.

An important paralog of this gene is ATAD3A.   
 
  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot Summary   :   May play a role in a mitochondrial network organization typical for stem cells, characterized by reduced mitochondrial metabolism, low mtDNA copies and fragmentated mitochondrial network. May act by suppressing ATAD3A function, interfering with ATAD3A interaction with matrix nucleoid complexes.

ATAD3A,"NCBI Gene Summary   :   This gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial membrane protein that contributes to mitochondrial dynamics, nucleoid organization, protein translation, cell growth, and cholesterol metabolism. This gene is a member of the ATPase family AAA-domain containing 3 gene family which, in humans, includes two other paralogs. Naturally occurring mutations in this gene are associated with distinct neurological syndromes including Harel-Yoon syndrome. High-level expression of this gene is associated with poor survival in breast cancer patients. A homozygous knockout of the orthologous gene in mice results in embryonic lethality at day 7.5 due to growth retardation and defective development of the trophoblast lineage. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2017]
